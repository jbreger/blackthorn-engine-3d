# Game Design #

In this document, please contribute ideas about game mechanics, monsters, story, setting, or other elements. Ideally this should focus on design and ideas, rather than implementation details.

# Setting / Back-Story #

## Who ##

**Humans** - The humans are explorers who have found a derelict spaceship.

**Ghosts** - The ghosts are all that's left of the crew of the ship. They are of some sort of alien species, possibly in this star system as part of a colonization or exploration effort. They guard the treasure; it is possible that they only continue to exist as ghosts because of the treasure.

## What ##

A group of human explorers exploring a derelict spaceship are trying to obtain a mysterious treasure. They are being hindered by the ghosts of a alien species, various strange animals still living on the space station, and deadly traps.

## Where ##

Deep in space, in a solar system far, far away from the Earth, there is a strange, derelict space station. It is haunted by the ghosts of an alien species, and is being plundered by intrepid human explorers...

## When ##

An indefinite amount of time in the future...

## Why ##

Why not? (Please put something interesting here if you have an idea why this scenario is happening.)


## Mechanics, Traps, and the Environment ##

  * Force fields that move air around
  * "Monsters" that are the descendants of animals brought for the colonization effort, some passive, some aggressive
  * Some power still available in places (which may help and/or hinder the player)
  * Sentry robots
  * Ghost players can possess the "monsters" and attack the humans
  * Human players have either a ranged weapon (blaster?) or a sword-like item (not a lightsaber!)
  * Flying monsters?
  * Gecko-like monsters than can be ridden by the human players
  * Some kind of monster that creates fire
  * Randomized dungeons, potentially?
  * Some areas have gravity effects (artificial gravity based on residual power?) and others do not

## Gameplay ##
  * Restrictions for zero-g environments
    * Should players re-orient to stand on whatever surface they're on, or should they always maintain the same up orientation
    * Should we let players jump to any surface, or restrict to axis-aligned surfaces
