Blackthorn 3D is a game engine written in Common Lisp. [Check out the wiki for more information](http://code.google.com/p/blackthorn-engine-3d/wiki/index).

A demo game, the Linux Kinetic Combat Action Simulator, is included with the source for Blackthorn 3D.

Initial development for this project was sponsored by [UCSD's CSE 125 course](http://pisa.ucsd.edu/cse125/) during spring 2011.

Blackthorn 3D **does not** supersede the old [Blackthorn 2D game engine](http://code.google.com/p/blackthorn-engine/). If you want 3D, use Blackthorn 3D; if you want 2D, use Blackthorn 2D. The APIs do not overlap. At this time there is no plan to integrate them.
