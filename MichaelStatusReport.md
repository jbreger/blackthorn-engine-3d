  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Implement octree for collision detection.
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Basic structure of octree, still needs testing though.
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Still need to work out how collisions are detected using the octree and how it will be used.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Finish octree, get it working, integrate it with the game.
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * Slowly but surely.

# Status Report 05/10/2011 #

  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Work with Robert on a way to create a way to convert models of levels
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Worked with Chris on incorporating collisions into game state.  Started work on combining collision objects and an octree.
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Unable to take a model and make collision objects directly. Octree is a step towards that.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Finish octree. Gravity, colliding with platforms.
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * The pieces are coming together.

# Status Report 05/03/2011 #

  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Implement a system that will test two lists of shapes against each other. Changed in weekly meeting to box/sphere collision.
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Robert implemented box/sphere collision with formulas from a book, so instead I created methods to make boxes from lists of points and refactored to remove a file interdependency.
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Did not accomplish making lists of shapes due to switching goals.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Work with Robert on a way to create a way to convert models of levels
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * Getting worried as I thought we would be farther along.

# Status Report 04/26/2011 #

  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Formula for sphere/box colliding, work out how these types will be determined in the code.  Changed goals in weekly meeting to getting working sphere/sphere collision code.
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Was able to implement functionality for sphere/sphere collision within the framework of the game along with tests.
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Did not accomplish sphere/box colliding due to switching goals.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Implement a system that will test two lists of shapes against each other. Changed to box/sphere collision.
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * Feeling better now that I wrote some working code.

# Status Report 04/19/2011 #

  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Detect two spheres colliding.
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Worked on necessary formulae for sphere/sphere, sphere/line colliding.
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Would like to work with graphics and data as it will be in the game.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Formula for sphere/box colliding, work out how these types will be determined in the code.
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * It's going slowly but surely.

  1. what were your concrete goals for the week?
    * Figure out how collisions will work.
  1. what goals were you able to accomplish?
    * Rough idea of how collision detection will work
  1. if there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons?
    * Would like to test collision detection but I need to talk to group members about graphics to figure out how to do that.
  1. what are your specific goals for the next week?
    * Detect two spheres colliding.
  1. what is your individual morale?
    * Doing good.
