  1. summarize your overall status for the week
    * The entity object has been integrated with the graphics and networking subsystems, allowing us to move an object around on the xz plane. Most essential elements of the renderer are implemented, and we have a couple models to start playing around with.
    * core networking works
    * camera and player are controllable across client-server
